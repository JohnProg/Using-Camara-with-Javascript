### objectdetect.hand-open.js ###

"Because many people have asked for it, I believe that it will make your life easier I give you my trained hand HAAR cascade xml file.
It's trained on about 20k positives and 20k negatives and works on any orientation.
Watch for high false positive rates. It also works with the cuda version of OpenCV.
It will help you but it won't make you happy."
